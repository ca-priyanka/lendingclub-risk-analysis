# lendingclub-risk-analysis

## Background
LendingClub is an American peer-to-peer lending company. P2P loans are loans made by individuals and investors – as opposed to loans that come from a bank. People with extra funds offer to lend that money to borroweres in need of cash. A P2P service (such as a website) matches lenders and borrowers so that the process is relatively easy for all parties.

## Objective
Loan default prediction is a common problem for lending companies. This analysis focusses on using the Lending Club dataset which is available on Kaggle. The objective is to make predictions about loan default and whether investors should lend to a customer or not based on their risk profile. Data is from 2007-2018 where most of the loans from that period have already been repaid or defaulted on.

The goal of this analysis is to identify credit-worthy customers that were not recognized by traditional credit scores,and predict the possibility of current loans becoming bad. This will help LendingClub minimize default risk and make higher profits in future.
